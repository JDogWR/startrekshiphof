                    The Defiant is the hero ship from the Star Trek: TNG spinoff Deep Space Nine. First appearing in the third season of DS9, this ship is quite the opposite of something like the Enterprise-D. Strictly built as a warship, the Defiant was small, powerful, and uniquely designed, with only 50 crew members and absolutely no luxuries of any kind. Designed by Captain Benjamin Sisko (then Commander Sisko), it was launched in 2370 in response to the other big power in the galaxy, The Dominion. Assigned to Deep Space 9, it proved its worth by being instrumental during the Dominion War. Unfortunately, the original USS Defiant was destroyed by the Breen during a battle in the Chin’toka System, in mid 2375. Fortunately, another one was quickly built and served until the Federation’s victory over the Dominion in late 2375. In such a short time, the Defiant earned herself a reputation as illustrious as the Enterprise-D had.
