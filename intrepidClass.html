                    The USS Voyager was an Intrepid Class starship designed for long range exploratory missions, originally launched in 2371. Just as powerful as a Galaxy Class, but faster and more maneuverable, Voyager boasted some of the most advanced technology to date. The original crew compliment was 153, but several crew members were lost after a powerful alien entity launched Voyager across the galaxy 70,000 lightyears from home. Under the command of Captain Kathryn Janeway, Voyager’s mission from then on was to get back home to Earth. During their tenure in what is known as the Delta Quadrant, Voyager would make first contact with hundreds of new species, have battles with the Borg, and even time travel. Voyager’s story would become the stuff of legend, with people still talking about it hundreds of years after Voyager’s initial journey.
